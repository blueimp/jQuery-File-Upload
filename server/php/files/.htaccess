### Headers
# To set header manipulation e.g.:
#   Header set Content-Disposition "attachment"
# you need to enable apache headers module which is not enabled by default.
# To enable:
# #> sudo a2enmod headers


### Settings

# The following directives prevent the execution of script files
# in the context of the website.
# They also force the content-type application/octet-stream and
# force browsers to display a download dialog for non-image files.
SetHandler default-handler
ForceType application/octet-stream
Header set Content-Disposition "attachment"

# The following unsets the forced type and Content-Disposition headers
# for known image files:
<FilesMatch "\.(?i:gif|jpe?g|png)$">
	ForceType none
	Header unset Content-Disposition
</FilesMatch>

# The following directive prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content-type.
# This is an important complement to the ForceType directive above:
Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff

### Authorization
# Uncomment the following lines to prevent unauthorized download of files:
#AuthName "Authorization required"
#AuthType Basic
#require valid-user
