  Individual file uploads can be canceled to stop the upload progress.
* **Resumable uploads:**  
  Aborted uploads can be resumed with browsers supporting the Blob API.

  The implementation is based on open standards like HTML5 and JavaScript and requires no additional browser plugins.
* **Graceful fallback for legacy browsers:**  
  Uploads files via XMLHttpRequests if supported and uses iframes as fallback for legacy browsers.

  Supports uploading files to a different domain with cross-site XMLHttpRequests or iframe redirects.

* **Compatible with any server-side application platform:**  
  Works with any server-side platform (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, Node.js, Go etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads.

## Requirements

### Mandatory requirements
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) v. 1.6+
* [jQuery UI widget factory](https://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/) v. 1.9+ (included): Required for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight without any other dependencies from the jQuery UI suite.
* [jQuery Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js) (included): Required for [browsers without XHR file upload support](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Browser-support).

### Optional requirements
* [JavaScript Templates engine](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates) v. 2.5.4+: Used to render the selected and uploaded files for the Basic Plus UI and jQuery UI versions.
* [JavaScript Load Image library](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image) v. 1.13.0+: Required for the image previews and resizing functionality.
* [JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob) v. 2.1.1+:Required for the image previews and resizing functionality.
* [blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) v. 2.15.1+: Used to display the uploaded images in a lightbox.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) v. 3.2.0+
* [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/)

The user interface of all versions except the jQuery UI version is built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and icons from [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/).

### Cross-domain requirements
[Cross-domain File Uploads](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Cross-domain-uploads) using the [Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js) require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The [example implementation](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js) makes use of [result.html](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/cors/result.html) as a static redirect page for the origin server.

The repository also includes the [jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js), which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests).  
The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the [Demo](https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) to delete uploaded files from the cross-domain demo file upload service.

### Custom Backends

You can add support for various backends by adhering to the specification [outlined here](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/JSON-Response).
