## Requirements

### Mandatory requirements
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) v. 1.6+
* [jQuery UI widget factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/) v. 1.9+ (included)
* [jQuery Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js) (included)

The jQuery UI widget factory is a requirement for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight without any other dependencies from the jQuery UI suite.

The jQuery Iframe Transport is required for [browsers without XHR file upload support](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Browser-support).

### Optional requirements
* [JavaScript Templates engine](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates) v. 2.3.1+
* [JavaScript Load Image library](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image) v. 1.9.1+
* [JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob) v. 2.0.7+
* [blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) v. 2.7.3+
* [Bootstrap CSS framework](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/) v. 3.0.0+
* [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/)

The JavaScript Templates engine is used to render the selected and uploaded files for the Basic Plus UI and jQuery UI versions.

The JavaScript Load Image library and JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill are required for the image previews and resizing functionality.

The blueimp Gallery is used to display the uploaded images in a lightbox.

The user interface of all versions except the jQuery UI version is built with Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/) framework and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

### Cross-domain requirements
[Cross-domain File Uploads](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Cross-domain-uploads) using the [Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js) require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The [example implementation](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js) makes use of [result.html](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/cors/result.html) as a static redirect page for the origin server.

The repository also includes the [jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js), which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests).  
The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the [Demo](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) to delete uploaded files from the cross-domain demo file upload service.
